# Digital_AC_Panel
Project for fun using tkinter and pygame to create a (very) basic gui and using sounds
Inspired by certain car companies' recent decisions to make formerly physical functions (high beam control, ac control, etc) only available through a digital screen (which is probably dangerous and bad, 
even though it's cheaper in this day and age)
